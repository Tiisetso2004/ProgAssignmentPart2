Basic Zoo Management Program

This is my project for part two of the assignment.
I have created a basic console application which implements an array list,inheritance,OOP 
and encapsulation.

The purpose of this application is to create multiple animal objects with declared attributes which will be displayed on the console for information.
Unit testing (JUnit-5) will cover my verification methods to ensure validity.

Read the attached comments and java documentation to follow my logic.
